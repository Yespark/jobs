# Yespark Backend Challenge

 Looking for a job? Check out our [open positions](https://www.yespark.fr/jobs)

## Guidelines

- clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at the end of each level
- once you are done, ping someone from Yespark (ideally via our jobs page)

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is:
- clean
- extensible
- robust (don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...)


## Things to know

- all prices are stored as integers (in cents)
